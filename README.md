# t3ext-yoast-seo

Yoast SEO plugin for TYPO3 CMS.

## Text analysis on every page in TYPO3 CMS

This plugin integrates text analysis and assessment from [YoastSEO.js](https://github.com/Yoast/YoastSEO.js). Content analysis can generate interesting metrics about a text and give you an assessment which can be used to improve the text.

## Focus keyword for every page/translation

The focus keyword is the keyword that you want your page to rank for. Using this plugin you can set a keyword for every page. The content analyzer takes this into account and lets you know if your copy uses it properly.

## Preview of snippet displayed on search result pages

Using the page title, pretty URL and meta description a preview is generated. It is possible to edit the page title and description directly from the snippet editor which will give you immediate feedback about the length and the use of a focus keyword.
